      <description>There are times when a thriller manages to keep you on the edge of your seat! ‚ÄòThe French Connection‚Äô, based on the book written by Robin Moore, is one such classic American drama that takes you back to the old days when cops chased crooks in ancient cars with thrills and lots of action.
The story is about two New York Police Department detectives Jimmy &amp;ldquo;Popeye&amp;rdquo; Doyle, played by veteran actor Gene Hackman and his partner &amp;ldquo;Cloudy&amp;rdquo; Russo, played by Roy Scheider, who manage to narrow down on a big narcotic deal that is going to take place in the city.</description>

      <description>(Prelude)
As we boarded the penultimate flight from SriLanka to India, I had mixed feelings. The number of deaths were on the rise and new COVID-19 cases were being reported each day across the globe. Finally, in the wee hours of 22nd March 2020, I reached Mumbai just in the nick of time. Luckily, I had not got the home quarantine stamp on my hands but there was a fear as to whether I would be allowed entry in our housing complex considering the return from a foreign land.</description>

      <description>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step! üòÑ
Solo traveling can be fun especially when you have planned it well. In the month of April 2019 when all my efforts in convincing my friends for an international tour had gone in vain, I decided to take up the solo path and started planning for my next trip. Apart from the basics like choosing the right destination, booking the right accommodation, scouting for cheaper flights and so on, there are also certain things that one needs to keep in mind while planning a solo trip.</description>

      <description>The movie Social Network has to be one of the most amazing movies that I have ever seen in my life. It was based on the book The Accidental Billionaries by Ben Mezrich.
There are so many great moments in this film. The brilliant screenplay by Aaron Sorkin coupled with apt dialogues make most scenes memorable even today. The entire cast of the film including the main protagonist Jesse Eisenberg (as Mark Zuckerberg in the movie) have played their role to perfection.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Success is due to our stretching to the challenges of life. Failure comes when we shrink from them.&amp;rdquo;
These words of John C. Maxwell are apt to describe a man&amp;rsquo;s journey from pain and discomfort to heartfelt success. Lance Armstrong needs no introduction. A world famous athlete who rode his bike a record seven consecutive times between 1999 and 2005 at the Tour de France.
The book discusses Armstrong&amp;rsquo;s life and how he struggled through cancer and emerged victorious.</description>

So, basically as a part of this anime we have two main characters namely : Goku (Son Goku)</description>
