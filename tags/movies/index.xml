      <description>The movie Social Network has to be one of the most amazing movies that I have ever seen in my life. It was based on the book The Accidental Billionaries by Ben Mezrich.
There are so many great moments in this film. The brilliant screenplay by Aaron Sorkin coupled with apt dialogues make most scenes memorable even today. The entire cast of the film including the main protagonist Jesse Eisenberg (as Mark Zuckerberg in the movie) have played their role to perfection.</description>
